#  🌐 Welcome to my library and mini e-commerce web app built with React!


This project was created as a learning exercise to develop my skills in building web applications with React. The app is a simulated online library, where users can browse and purchase books.

To bring this project to life, I utilized a variety of tools and technologies, including React Context and React Router DOM to manage state and navigation within the app. I also used Netlify to deploy the app, making it easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

I hope you enjoy using this app as much as I enjoyed creating it. Thank you for visiting!
